# Part 1

## 1.

Assume that the old and new log-likelihood, which is respectively built by $K$ and $K+M$ variable are

$$
\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta_{new}}) = \mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta_{old}}) + d
$$

Then,

$$
\bar{\rho}_{new}^2 > \bar{\rho}_{new}^2 \\
\Leftrightarrow 1 - \frac{[\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta_{old}}) + d - K - M]}{\mathcal{L}(0)} > 1 - \frac{[\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta_{old}}) - K]}{\mathcal{L}(0)} \\
\Leftrightarrow \mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta_{old}}) + d - K - M > \mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta_{old}}) - K \text{ (} \mathcal{L}(0) < 0\text{ )}\\
\Leftrightarrow d > M
$$

Note that $d$ must be non-negative because if we add some variables, the new model now has a higher ability to explain the outcome. We want to estimate the outcome by the set of variances which exists in our variables (e.g., principal component analysis will examine this quality). Therefore, unless all the new variables has zero variance (= constant), the power of estimating the outcome would increase.

## 2.

The log-likelihood of market share model can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathcal{L}(\text{MS}) &= \sum_n[y_{in} ln(P_i) + (1 - y_{in}) ln(1 - P_i)] \\
  &= ln(P_i) \sum_n{y_{in}} + ln(1 - P_i) \sum_n{1 - y_{in}} \\
  &= N_i ln(P_i) + (N - N_i) ln(1 - P_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

To maximize this, the condition in the first derivative must be satisfied.

$$
  \mathcal{L'}(\text{MS}) = \frac{N_i}{P_i} - \frac{(N - N_i)}{1 - P_i} = 0 \\
  \Leftrightarrow N_i (1 - P_i) = (N - N_i) P_i \\
  \Leftrightarrow N_i = N P_i \\
  \Leftrightarrow P_i = N_i / N
$$

The second derivative is

$$
  \mathcal{L''}(\text{MS}) = - \frac{N_i}{P_i^2} - \frac{(N - N_i)}{(1 - P_i)^2}
$$

Given that $N_i, P_i^2, (N - N_i)$ and $(1 - P_i)^2$ is positive, this is always negative.  
It indicates that the extremum given by $P_i = N_i / N$ is the maximum.
