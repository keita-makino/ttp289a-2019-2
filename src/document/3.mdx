Below is the result of our basic (BS) model.

<Regression
  inputs={[
    'apd',
    'opb',
    'opw',
    'opc',
    'f1gensvc',
    'f2convac',
    'f3psych',
    'cost'
  ]}
  base={2}
  table={{ title: 'hoge' }}
/>

Note that coefficients which span the three columns represents that the corresponding variable is a generic variable. Looking at the result, we can see that the most of variables exhibit a significance with more than 95% confidence level.
